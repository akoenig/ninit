# ninit - node module bootstrapper

A community-driven node module bootstrapper.

## What?

There are so many flavors to structure a Node.js application / module. Every developer has it own style. That is great! `ninit`'s aim is to provide a platform on which every developer can publish her personal application / module template in order to share best practices and therefore help to evolve the quality of the Node.js module system. Let's get started!

## Installation

    npm install -g ninit

## Usage example

    ninit akoenig.expressapp

_ninit_ will generate a new application that has the structure of the `akoenig.expressapp` template.


If you need an overview about the available templates you could check the respective [directory](https://github.com/akoenig/ninit/tree/master/templates) or just type

    ninit ls
